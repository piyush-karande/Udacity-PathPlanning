# Path Planning #
The goal of this project was navigate a car on a three lane highway in a simulated enviorment. Specifically:

1. Car should follow a smooth trajectory without violating maximum velociy, acceleration, and jerk restrictions.
2. Car should not crash other cars on the 3 lane highway.
3. Car should stay inside its lane and change lanes to avoid getting stuck behind a slow car, while following all safety rules.
4. Car should use the localization, sensor fusion, and map data to perform the above mentioned tasks.
